# MATLAB-Scopes
A small collection of scopes for real time display of signals in MATLAB.

This is a set of functions that make it easy to include real-time updating displays in your measurement application. TMWidgets includes three widgets: a strip chart (for time series), a spectrum scope (for frequency) a specgramscope (for frequency and time) and a thermometer (for scalar display).
